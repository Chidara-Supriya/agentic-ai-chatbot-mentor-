Agentic AI Chatbot Mentor 🤖
Project Description

The Agentic AI Chatbot Mentor is an intelligent learning assistant designed to guide learners based on their experience level and learning goals. Unlike traditional chatbots that provide the same responses to all users, this mentor adapts its guidance according to the user’s selected experience range (1–11 years), making learning more personalized and effective.

The chatbot acts like a virtual mentor, helping users understand concepts, clear doubts, and receive structured guidance across multiple technical domains. By using Agentic AI principles, the system follows step-by-step reasoning, understands user intent, and delivers meaningful responses rather than generic answers.
